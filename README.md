# Exercitia Latina

This repository contains the source code for the Exercitia Latina website. (without the actual data)


Although this was originally made for LLPSI, this is basically a "fill in the blanks" website, so it can be used for any such use case with practically no code changes.

## Development

For development, you will need to use the dummy-backend. (A simple express server that serves the dummy data)

And create a `.env` file (based on `.env.example`)
