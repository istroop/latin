# Exercitia Latina

This repository contains the source code for the Exercitia Latina website. (without the actual data)


Although this was originally made for LLPSI, this is basically a "fill in the blanks" website, so it can be used for any such use case with practically no code changes.

## Deployment

This project uses next.js static export, so it can be deployed anywhere that supports static sites.
